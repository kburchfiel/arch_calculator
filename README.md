# Arch Calculator:
## A Python program that applies trigonometry to calculate the coordinates of components of an arch

*My blog post on this program can be found at https://kburchfiel3.wordpress.com/2022/03/23/arch-calculator-a-python-program-that-applies-trigonometry-to-make-3d-modeling-easier/.*

I created Arch Calculator in order to more easily calculate the coordinates of arches within Blender, a free and open-source 3D modeling program. The program allows you to create different arch shapes by modifying various input parameters, such as the height and thickness of the arch wedges and the angle of the diagonal components of each wedge. You can even use the program to calculate the coordinates of angled walls (such as the walls comprising an octagonal room).
